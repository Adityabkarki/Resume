                <p>Aditya did great work for us. He was very focused and he was always contributing positively to our team. I believe he would be a strong contributor to any company. It would be great to have him with us still.</p>

                <h5>People Tranformation at Slalom</h5>
                <p>I met Aditya in Nepal while working together on the Delivery Project Management Team for CloudFactory. Before I actually met him, I had heard stories of him being incredibly driven, a self-learner, and the go-to problem solver when it came to complex projects. All of those boxes were checked and exceeded when I saw him in action. Aditya is one of the best people to work with because of his can-do attitude, deep dedication, and ability to manage large teams through challenges and setbacks. Oh, and he never settles for stagnancy. He is always pursuing more learning, higher-level thinking, or trying to get better each day. Because of these traits, I was able to trust him to get any job done successfully. Proud of how you have grown Aditya, and really looking forward to how you will continue to make a positive impact!</p>

                <p>Aditya has always displayed the utmost professionalism and calm when assisting some extremely heated Customers with their complex technical issue resolutions. We worked together on multiple Projects at CloudFactory, with Aditya constantly diving deep into complex problems and coming up with creative solutions. He is able to apply a very different perspective to a problem which can alter the way his team approaches a resolution, often with quick success! I always enjoyed our troubleshooting conversations as well as discussion on what to watch next on Netflix. Aditya is an avid reader, constantly learning and growing himself, please do ask him for his latest recommendation!</p>
